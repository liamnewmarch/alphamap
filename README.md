## Alphamap

This is an old AS3 (Flash) project I created at university which I’ve ported to JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.

Starting at the top left, each cell takes average value of the cell above and to its left, plus or minus a small variance.

Originally this was only on the alpha channel (hence the name “alphamap”). In this version the colour channels red, green, and blue are calculated independently.
